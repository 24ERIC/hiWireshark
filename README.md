# Research - wireshark feature

- Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic ‚Äì quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
- Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
- Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.

# Research - Wireshark has a rich feature set which includes the following:

- Deep inspection of hundreds of protocols, with more being added all the time
- Live capture and offline analysis
- Standard three-pane packet browser
- Multi-platform: Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and many others
- Captured network data can be browsed via a GUI, or via the TTY-mode TShark utility
- The most powerful display filters in the industry
- Rich VoIP analysis
- Read/write many different capture file formats: tcpdump (libpcap), Pcap NG, Catapult DCT2000, Cisco Secure IDS iplog, Microsoft Network Monitor, Network General Sniffer¬Æ (compressed and uncompressed), Sniffer¬Æ Pro, and NetXray¬Æ, Network Instruments Observer, NetScreen snoop, Novell LANalyzer, RADCOM WAN/LAN Analyzer, Shomiti/Finisar Surveyor, Tektronix K12xx, Visual Networks Visual UpTime, WildPackets EtherPeek/TokenPeek/AiroPeek, and many others
- Capture files compressed with gzip can be decompressed on the fly
- Live data can be read from Ethernet, IEEE 802.11, PPP/HDLC, ATM, Bluetooth, USB, Token Ring, Frame Relay, FDDI, and others (depending on your platform)
- Decryption support for many protocols, including IPsec, ISAKMP, Kerberos, SNMPv3, SSL/TLS, WEP, and WPA/WPA2
- Coloring rules can be applied to the packet list for quick, intuitive analysis
- Output can be exported to XML, PostScript¬Æ, CSV, or plain text


# Research - Network Basic

| Name | What is it? | What it do? | Note |
|------|------------|--------------|------|
| TCP (Transmission control protocol) | intermediate layer of the application layer and internet protocol layer | - creates a connection before transmit data <br> - big data to small before send <br> - reassembling at destination <br> - retransmission <br>  | - the client begins the communication and establishes a connection with a server <br> |


# Research - [Steps to create a client using TCP/IP  API](https://aticleworld.com/socket-programming-in-c-using-tcpip/)

- Create a socket with the socket() system call.
- Initialize the socket address structure as per the server and connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call.
- Receive and send the data using the recv() and send().
- Close the connection by calling the close() function.


# Research - Steps to create a server using TCP/IP API

- Create a socket with the socket() system call.
- Initialize the socket address structure and bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call.
- Listen for connections with the listen() system call.
- Accept a connection with the accept() system call. This call typically blocks until a client connects to the server.
- Receive and send data by using the recv() and send().
- Close the connection by using the close().
