## research include
- <> for system path header
- "" for working directory header


## research
- include <stdio.h>, related to standard in and out, popular method is print, scanf
- include <stdlib.h>, related to stanard library, popular method is malloc, free, realloc, calloc
- include <string.h>, related to string, memory, file, extremely popular header
- 

## research method
- malloc, allocate memory block
- free, 


## research 
- include
- #define
    - int a = MAXLINE;
    - the const Qualifier to Define Constants
    - preprocessor directive
    - #define <VAR_NAME> <VALUE>
    - you may get a warning that you're trying to redefine an already-defined constant.
- const
    - to be s constant
    - cannot redefine an existing variable. 
    - can always reassign values of a variable.
    - using the const qualifier to render variables to be read-only.


## research 
- strcpy
    - in the string.h header file.
    - (des, source)
- buffer
    -  it is any piece of memory where data is stored temporarily until it is processed or copied to the final destination
- #include <conio.h>
    - int getch();



## research 
- declare
    - char
        - char c = "s";
    - string
        - char s[] = "hllo";
    - int
        - int i = 1;
- pointer
    - char s[] = "hello";
    - char *p = s;
    - *(p+1) = 'a';
    - s[2] = 'a';
    - printf("%s", p);
- realloc
    - Changes the size of the memory block pointed to by ptr.
    - The function may move the memory block to a new location (whose address is returned by the function).
    - 
- malloc
    - memory allocation
    - allocate a block of memory dynamically
    - ptr = (cast_type *) malloc (byte_size);
